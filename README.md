# Loan_Portfolio
The code defines a Loan class and a LoanPortfolio class for managing loans and loan portfolios.
Loans have attributes such as id, amount, interest_rate, start_date, end_date, and status, and methods for calculating interest and getting/updating loan status.
LoanPortfolio can add and remove loans, calculate total interest for active loans, get loan status by ID, update loan status, and generate a specified number of random overdue loans.
The main block of code tests the LoanPortfolio class by creating two loans, adding three random overdue loans, and printing loan details and total interest for the portfolio.
The code demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as class inheritance, object instantiation, attribute and method definition, and function chaining.
